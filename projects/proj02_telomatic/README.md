# Project 2: Telomatic



## [Assignment](https://pippinbarr.github.io/cart263/projects/project2/)
## [Proposal](https://github.com/ylliez/CART263/tree/main/projects/proj02_proposal)  

## Artist's Statement
Telomatic is an exploration of post-digital intersubjectivity seeking to comment on and propose playfully engaging alternatives to the dematerialization of contemporary virtualized landscapes through a collective online drawing experience.  
The viewer engages with the piece through a web application proposing an augmented reality drawing activity using machine-learning trained models allowing real-time hand pose detection. Using their right index finger, the viewer traces a line of which the weight and colour can be modulated with the left index finger. A digital finger-painting canvas, overlain on the webcam video feed.  
The viewer can also take a screenshot of their drawing, which is uploaded to a gallery and echoed back to the viewer as a scannable QR code.

The application rests on a structure of HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP, and implements [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [jQueryUI](https://jqueryui.com/), [MediaPipe Hands](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html) for hand position detection as well as [QRCode.js](https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs) to generate and format the QR code.
