## Project 1.1: Steely Stylite

### [Play!](https://ylliez.github.io/CART263/projects/proj01_movieNight/proj01_steelyStylite/)

Immerse yourself in the life of a 5th-century Syrian stylite using machine-learning posture detection technology!<br>
Symeon the Stylite (d. 459) was a Christian ascetic who was known for spending 37 years atop a pillar in religious devotion, inspiring many imitators (known as stylites from the greek word for pillar).<br>
In this game, you assume Symeon's stylitic position and must maintain the balance of your upper body in your webcam to stay atop the pillar.<br>

Based on Luis Buñuel's *Simón del desierto* (1965)<br>
