### Statement
Reflections on *The Clock* (Christian Marclay, 2010), a looped 24-hour video supercut featuring timepieces the diagetic chronology of which corresponds to real-world time when the projection is synchronized.<br>
The piece has given rise to much commentary (e.g. [Russel, 2013](http://catherinerussell.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Russell-FW-54-2-Archival-Cinephilia-in-The-Clock.pdf)), of which one specific aspect - intellectual property rights - has drawn more widespread attention and it at the core of this piece.
Briefly put, while Marclay's video art piece is a montage of appropriated clips from a variety of famous films (albeit drawn from a geographically and culturally restricted canon), it has remained elusive to pirating efforts (and was sold in a very limited edition for about half a million a pop). This piece is a response to this copyright hermeticism, whereby even attempts at crowdsourcing have failed to yield more than an unfinished document giving imperfect verbal descriptions of the scenes. Where such description exists, it is displayed in this schematic outline of a clock, pointing in the direction a minute hand would point at the given time, while the shorter hour hand, analogically oriented, displays the time.

### R&D

~~Attempt to pirate The Clock (an ongoing vendetta) to obtain individual sequences and recreate a frame by frame rendition of the piece using a CPU-breaking JSON file.~~ -> perpetually frustrated<br>
~~Attempt to use [crowdsource clock variant](https://theclockmarclay.wikia.com/wiki/Crowdsourcing-The-Clock)~~ -> presently defunct<br>
~~Consider technical alternative? (e.g. [Human Clock project](https://humanclock.com/))~~ -> meh..<br>
~~Consider conceptual meta (e.g. associate access time with other info (e.g. wiki entry or bible verse?)~~ -> Ã¼ber-meh..<br>
Consider conceptual alternative (e.g. stretched, cf Gordon's 24 Hour Psycho) -> became Doigt Andalou<br>
Consider technic-conceptual alternative (e.g. [text-repo of The Clock](http://clockclock.ars.is/)) -> Clock Pyright
