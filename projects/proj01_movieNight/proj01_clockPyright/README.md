The piece has given rise to much commentary (e.g. ), a specific aspect of which has drawn more widespread attention.

### R&D

~~Attempt to pirate The Clock (an ongoing vendetta) to obtain individual sequences and recreate a frame by frame rendition of the piece using a CPU-breaking JSON file.~~ -> perpetually frustrated<br>
~~Attempt to use crowdsource clock variant~~ -> presently defunct<br>
~~Consider technical alternative? (e.g. [Human Clock project](https://humanclock.com/))~~ -> meh..<br>
~~Consider conceptual meta (e.g. associate access time with other info (e.g. wiki entry or bible verse?)~~ -> Ã¼ber-meh..<br>
Consider conceptual alternative (e.g. stretched, cf Gordon's 24 Hour Psycho) -> became Doigt Andalou<br>
Consider technic-conceptual alternative (e.g. [text-repo of The Clock](http://clockclock.ars.is/)) -> Clock Pyright
