### Statement
Reflections on *The Clock* (Christian Marclay, 2010), a looped 24-hour video supercut featuring timepieces the diagetic chronology of which, when the projection is synchronized, correspond with real-world time.<br>
The piece has given rise to much commentary (e.g. [Russel, 2013](http://catherinerussell.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Russell-FW-54-2-Archival-Cinephilia-in-The-Clock.pdf)), of which one specific aspect - intellectual property rights - has drawn more widespread attention and it at the core of this piece.

### R&D

~~Attempt to pirate The Clock (an ongoing vendetta) to obtain individual sequences and recreate a frame by frame rendition of the piece using a CPU-breaking JSON file.~~ -> perpetually frustrated<br>
~~Attempt to use crowdsource clock variant~~ -> presently defunct<br>
~~Consider technical alternative? (e.g. [Human Clock project](https://humanclock.com/))~~ -> meh..<br>
~~Consider conceptual meta (e.g. associate access time with other info (e.g. wiki entry or bible verse?)~~ -> Ã¼ber-meh..<br>
Consider conceptual alternative (e.g. stretched, cf Gordon's 24 Hour Psycho) -> became Doigt Andalou<br>
Consider technic-conceptual alternative (e.g. [text-repo of The Clock](http://clockclock.ars.is/)) -> Clock Pyright
