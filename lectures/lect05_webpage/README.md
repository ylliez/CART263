# CART263 - Lecture 05 - The Webpage

HTML stands for (H)yper(T)ext (M)arkup (L)anguage. It’s the language we use to express the structure and content of a webpage. It’s fundamentally premised on the idea of a webpage as a document and thus privileges the idea of a linear presentation of formatted text (and other elements).

HTML is recognizable for its use of specific tags like <html>, <p>, <img> to indicate the structure of a document. These tags essentially are HTML, they are the markup.
